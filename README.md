Problem Overview
 As the global population continues to grow, the volume of municipal solid 
waste (MSW) generated also rises, posing significant environmental and 
societal challenges. Current waste management systems are often 
inefficient, contributing to escalating landfill use, increasing greenhouse 
gas emissions, and failing to maximize recycling potential. This presents a 
pressing need for innovative solutions that reduce waste volume, minimize 
environmental harm, and promote the sustainable use of resources
Solution
 A smart, integrated waste-to-energy system can reduce landfill 
waste, generate renewable energy, and promote sustainable 
community practices, improving air quality and overall waste 
management efficiency.
